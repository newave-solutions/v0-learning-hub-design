# AI Learning Hub - Project Overview & Teaching Methodology

## 📚 Educational Framework

### Learning Philosophy

The AI Learning Hub is built on a modern educational framework that recognizes the fundamental shift in software development brought about by AI tools. The platform teaches developers to be "AI-Augmented Architects" rather than traditional syntax-focused programmers.

### Core Teaching Principles

1. **From Writing to Auditing**: Shift focus from writing every line of code to critically evaluating AI-generated output
2. **Pattern Recognition Over Memorization**: Emphasize understanding patterns rather than memorizing syntax
3. **Security-First Mindset**: Teach developers to spot vulnerabilities in AI-generated code
4. **Deliberate Practice**: Balance AI-assisted development with manual coding to prevent skill atrophy
5. **Contextual Learning**: Use real-world scenarios and practical examples throughout

## 🎯 Learning Path Structure

### Four-Phase Progression

The curriculum is organized into four progressive phases, each building on the previous:

#### Phase 1: The BS Detector (Foundation)
**Goal**: Develop the ability to identify when AI is making mistakes

**Pedagogical Approach**:
- Start with "why" before "what" - explain the importance of code literacy in the AI era

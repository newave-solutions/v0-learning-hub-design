## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### OAuth Sign-In Implementation

The AI Learning Hub implements a comprehensive authentication system that supports both OAuth (Google) and traditional email/password authentication. This section outlines the implementation details, security best practices, and setup instructions.

#### OAuth Provider Setup (Google Authentication)

**1. Google Cloud Console Configuration**

To enable Google OAuth authentication, you need to configure a project in the Google Cloud Console:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google+ API for your project

2. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" for user type (or "Internal" for Google Workspace organizations)
   - Fill in required information:
     - App name: "AI Learning Hub"
     - User support email: Your support email
     - Developer contact email: Your contact email
   - Add scopes: `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`, and `openid`
   - Add test users during development phase

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Web application" as application type
   - Configure authorized origins:
     - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
     - Production: `https://your-domain.com`
   - Configure authorized redirect URIs:
     - Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
     - Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Save the Client ID and Client Secret

**2. Environment Variables Configuration**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here

# Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET with: openssl rand -base64 32
```

**3. Security Best Practices for OAuth**

- **Client Secret Protection**: Never commit the `.env.local` file to version control
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production for OAuth redirects
- **State Parameter**: Implement CSRF protection using state parameter (handled by NextAuth.js)
- **Token Storage**: Store access tokens securely, never in localStorage
- **Token Refresh**: Implement token refresh logic to maintain user sessions
- **Scope Limitation**: Request only the minimum required OAuth scopes
- **Callback Validation**: Always validate OAuth callbacks and state parameters

#### Username and Password Best Practices

**1. Password Requirements**

Implement strong password requirements following OWASP guidelines:

```typescript
// Password validation criteria
const passwordRequirements = {
  minLength: 8,           // Minimum 8 characters
  maxLength: 128,         // Maximum 128 characters
  requireUppercase: true, // At least one uppercase letter
  requireLowercase: true, // At least one lowercase letter
  requireNumbers: true,   // At least one number
  requireSpecial: true,   // At least one special character
}

// Example password validation function
function validatePassword(password: string): { valid: boolean; errors: string[] } {
  const errors: string[] = []
  
  if (password.length < 8) {
    errors.push("Password must be at least 8 characters long")
  }
  if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter")
  }
  if (!/[a-z]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push("Password must contain at least one lowercase letter")
  }
  if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push("Password must contain at least one number")
  }
  if (!/[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push("Password must contain at least one special character")
  }
  
  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors }
}
```

**2. Password Storage and Hashing**

Never store passwords in plain text. Use industry-standard hashing algorithms:

- **Recommended**: bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt
- **Minimum Cost Factor**: bcrypt with cost factor of 12+
- **Salt**: Automatically generated per password (handled by bcrypt)

```typescript
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'

// Hashing a password
async function hashPassword(plainPassword: string): Promise<string> {
  const saltRounds = 12
  return await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds)
}

// Verifying a password
async function verifyPassword(plainPassword: string, hashedPassword: string): Promise<boolean> {
  return await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hashedPassword)
}
```

**3. Username Best Practices**

- **Email as Username**: Use email addresses as usernames for simplicity and password recovery
- **Validation**: Validate email format using regex or validation libraries
- **Uniqueness**: Ensure email addresses are unique in the database
- **Case Sensitivity**: Store and compare emails in lowercase
- **Verification**: Implement email verification for new accounts

```typescript
// Email validation
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
  return emailRegex.test(email)
}

// Normalize email
function normalizeEmail(email: string): string {
  return email.toLowerCase().trim()
}
```

**4. Account Security Features**

Implement additional security measures:

- **Rate Limiting**: Limit login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
  - Max 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes
  - Exponential backoff after repeated failures
  
- **Account Lockout**: Temporarily lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts
  - Lock duration: 30 minutes after 5 failed attempts
  - Email notification on account lockout
  
- **Password Reset Flow**:
  1. User requests password reset
  2. Generate secure, time-limited token (valid for 1 hour)
  3. Send token via email
  4. Validate token before allowing password change
  5. Invalidate all existing sessions on password change
  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Consider implementing TOTP-based 2FA for additional security
  - Use libraries like `speakeasy` or `otpauth`
  - Provide backup codes for account recovery
  - Allow users to enable/disable 2FA in settings

**5. Session Management**

- **Session Duration**: Set reasonable session timeouts (e.g., 7 days for "remember me")
- **Session Storage**: Use secure, httpOnly cookies for session tokens
- **Session Invalidation**: Provide logout functionality that clears all session data
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Allow users to view and revoke active sessions

#### Implementation Architecture

**Current Implementation Status:**

The application currently includes:
- Sign-in page (`/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`) with Google OAuth and email/password options
- Sign-up page (`/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`) with account creation flows
- Auth context (`/lib/auth-context.tsx`) for managing authentication state
- Mock authentication for demonstration purposes

**Production Implementation Checklist:**

- Never expose stack traces to users

**Compliance:**
- GDPR: Implement data deletion and export features
- CCPA: Provide privacy policy and data handling information
- Password policies should comply with NIST guidelines
- Implement proper consent mechanisms for data collection

#### Testing Authentication

Create comprehensive tests for authentication flows:

```typescript
// Example test cases
describe('Authentication', () => {
  describe('Sign Up', () => {
    it('should create account with valid email and password')
    it('should reject weak passwords')
    it('should prevent duplicate email registration')
    it('should send verification email')
  })
  
  describe('Sign In', () => {
    it('should authenticate with correct credentials')
    it('should reject incorrect credentials')
    it('should enforce rate limiting')
    it('should lock account after failed attempts')
  })
  
  describe('OAuth', () => {
    it('should authenticate with Google OAuth')
    it('should handle OAuth errors gracefully')
    it('should create user profile from OAuth data')
  })
  
  describe('Password Reset', () => {
    it('should generate reset token')
    it('should validate reset token expiry')
    it('should update password with valid token')
  })
})
```
